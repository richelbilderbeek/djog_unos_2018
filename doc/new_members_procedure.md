# New members procedure

The new members procedure may differ between Thursday and Friday

## Thursday

People are eligible if they are at least 13 years old.

Every evening, there is the option for maximally one Team Octane candidate.

The candidate can start any Thursday, in agreement with at least one Team Octane 
member, who will act as a mentor for that day.

At the end of the evening, there will be a vote for allowing the candidate
to become a member. This voting will be done with the candidate absent.
If 75% or more vote in favor, the candidate is accepted. 
In case of a draw, Richel's vote counts double.

After the voting, the candidate is informed directly.
If the candidate is accepted, that candidate becomes a member. 
Else the candidate is allowed to try again the next season.

## Friday

No meeting on this yet.
