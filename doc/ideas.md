## Proposing an idea ##

To propose a new feature you have to open a new issue, with the appropriate template.
This idea will be checked by for example UX, and if the majority of the team likes it, it will probably be added to the game.

## Suggesting a solution ##

From time to time there will be issues with the label 'idea', that meand you can suggest a solution for something.
This is usually a new feature. When a suggest issue is open it will be mentioned on thursday and friday.
Multiple suggestions can be made per person.

Note that you shouldn't bring out a vote or oppinion on issues labeled 'idea'.

## Voting on a solution ##

When an issue has the label vote, you can vote for a solution.
This usually comes after the suggest deadline of an issue has passed.
Votes should be done in this format:

Idea|Proposed by|Vote
---|---|---
idea 1|John|N
idea 2|Dan|Y
Blue orbs|Sam|Y

Idea: a name for the idea, for example "Blue orbs" if the idea is add blue orbs.
Proposed by: This is to make clearer which idea you mean (not always necessary).
Vote: Y(es) or N(o), you can bring out multiple votes (see example).

Note that you can't suggest new ideas during votes.

If it's a tie, either the UX, Richels, or the creator of the issue gets a double vote.
